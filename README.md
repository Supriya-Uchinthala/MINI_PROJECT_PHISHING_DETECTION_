# **Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning**

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=Phishing+Detection+Using+ML)  
*A comprehensive approach to detecting phishing attempts via URLs, messages, phone numbers, and QR codes.*

---

## **üìñ Overview**  
Phishing is one of the most prevalent forms of cybercrime, targeting individuals and organizations alike. This project leverages **Machine Learning** to develop a robust system capable of identifying phishing attempts across various mediums, including:  
- **URLs**: Identifies suspicious or malicious web links.  
- **Messages**: Analyzes the text of SMS and email content for potential phishing.  
- **Phone Numbers**: Flags numbers associated with known phishing campaigns or scams.  
- **QR Codes**: Decodes and validates QR codes to prevent redirection to malicious sites.  

---

## **‚ú® Key Features**  
- **URL Analysis**: Uses feature extraction and classification models to detect malicious links.  
- **Message Content Analysis**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify phishing patterns in textual content.  
- **Phone Number Validation**: Checks phone numbers against a database of known scammers and applies heuristic rules.  
- **QR Code Scanning**: Decodes QR codes and performs safety checks on their content.  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Lightweight, efficient models suitable for integration into live systems.  
- **High Accuracy**: Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms for optimal performance.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models.  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data preprocessing.  
  - `NLTK` and `spaCy` for text analysis.  
  - `OpenCV` and `pyzbar` for QR code processing.  
- **Deployment**: Flask/Django for backend API, Docker for containerization.
